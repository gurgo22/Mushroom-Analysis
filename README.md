# Prediction of Poisonous Mushrooms

This is a machine learning project that uses **Random Forest Classification** to determine whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible. The project showcases my skills in data preprocessing, feature selection, and modeling, as well as the interpretability of Random Forest through feature importance analysis.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for machine learning.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most important features for classification.
- **Random Forest Model**: Building and training a Random Forest classifier.
- **Interpretability**: Analyzing feature importance to understand the model's decision-making process.

## Technology Stack

- **Python** – Core programming language.
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning library for building and evaluating models.
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations and data transformations.
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization.
