Prediction of poisonous mushrooms


This is a machine learning project that uses Random Forest classification to determine whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible.

This project showcases my basic skills in data preprocessing, choosing correct features, and modeling.

It also shows the interpretability of the Random Forest classification through feature importance analysis.
